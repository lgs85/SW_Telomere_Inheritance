# Telomeres and offspring sex ratio in the Seychelles warbler

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

You can find the manuscript in the "manuscripts" section. It's called "Telomere_parentage_v1.docx". Note that there is also a file called "Telomere_parentage_v1.Rmd". This is the script used to produce the paper and won't be much use unless you use R markdown.

The table and figure legends are also in the manuscript folder. They are in a file called "Telomere_parentage_TABLES_AND_FIGURES.docx".

The SOM is in the manscript folder and is called "Telomere_parentage_SOM.docx"

The figures are in the "Figures" folder. There are 3.
